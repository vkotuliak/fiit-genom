## Usage

To work with the **ClinVar** database you first need to download it through following [link](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/clinvar/xml/). After downloading, you can use file `clinvar_xml_to_csv.py` to turn it into csv (you will need to change the name of file to *clinvar_dataset.xml.gz* or change it in code).

You can use file `make_graphics.py` to draw different graphics about the csv with clinvar data.

There are also files `clinvar_preview.py` and `example.xml` which are just short snippets from the original xml saved in clinvar database.
